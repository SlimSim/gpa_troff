    <h2>What is Troff</h2>
    <p>
      Troff is a media player that let you loop a part of a song, 
      slow it down and create markers on the song timeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is designed for practicing with music, it is perfect for dancers working
      on a choreography or for musicians learning to play a song.
    </p>
    <h3 id="about">About this guide</h3>
    <p>
      This guide often uses the word "song" instead of "song or movie".
    </p>
    <p>
      Keyboard shortcuts will be written inside of "()".
    </p>
    <p>
      Troff is layed out in different sections or areas. 
      They will be refered to as areas in this guide.
    </p>      
      
    <!--
Troff helps you with this by adding markers to the song timeline, making it easy to find the parts of the song you need to work on! 

Adding a marker before and after a certain part of a song let you loop that part of the song automatically. This way you get the maximum amount of practice time.

Troff lets you easily change the tempo of the song, to let you work on harder parts slowly before you are ready for 100% or even faster!

Need to learn a routine from a movie? No problem; now Troff supports movies!
You can still use markers, change tempo and loop sequences with the film clip.

Troff is not connected to Drive, it plays your songs from your local hard-drive. This way it will work as well offline as online!

  <article id="howToAddMedia">
    <h2>How to add and play music or movies</h2>
    <p>
      When you start Troff, if you don't have any songs in the Songs area,
      you must add a folder on your computer with songs in it. 
      Do this by clicking the "Select folders" button in the Songs area, 
      select one of the suggestion-folders or add a new folder by clicking 
      "Add Location...". When you are done, click "Apply" and you will se all
      the songs from those folders in the songs area. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have songs in the songs area, 
      click a song and it will be selected. This is indicated by it becoming
      purple. When the song is loaded, the text "Wait for song to load" written
      in the top section, will be replaced by the song name, artist and album.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Note: If the text "Wait for song to load" does not disapear, 
      then Troff might not be able to play that particular song.
      Try to convert the song to mp3 (or movies to mp4) and try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To play the song, press the round play-button in the top area or (Space), 
      the song will then wait 3 seconds before start. If you don't want
      to wait 3 seconds, either press the Enter-key, 
      or continue to read this guide.
    </p>
  </article> <!-- add and play music -->
  <article id="settings">
    <h2>The settings area</h2>
      <p>
        The settings area is where you configure Troff to play the current
        song the way you like it. Here you decide how fast the song will 
        be played, how many times, which part of the song that will be played
        and more.
      </p>
    <h3 id="markers">Markers - what are those?</h3>
    <p>
      Markers are labels that you can add to the timeline.
      The timeline in Troff is vertical and streaches the full heigth of the
      player. 
      The markers contains text, and can be colorized so that you easy can
      find specific parts of the song later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add a marker, press "Add marker!" or (M), then the "create new marker"
      dialog appears, here you can write the marker name (will be visible 
      on the timeline).
    </p>
    <p>
      The marker will be added to the timeline where the cursor was when you 
      pressed the button, but the location of the marker can be adjusted in the 
      "create new marker" dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the info-area you can add more info to the marker. 
      This will not take up space on the timeline but will be easily 
      accessible at the <a href="#infoArea">info part</a>.
      This dialog also lets you decide the color of the marker.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can always press the edit button (<i class="fa fa-pencil-alt"></i>) next 
      to a marker to bring up the same dialog to edit the marker.
    </p>
    <h3 id="playPartOfSong">Play only part of a song</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to play only a part of a song, click the marker where you 
      want to start and the marker will be selected (indicated by the purple 
      color). Then click the "stop" tab next to the marker where you want Troff
      to stop playing, the purple color indicates that the "stop" tab is
      selected.
      When you press "play" only the selected part of the song will be played, 
      the selected part is shown in purple on the timeline.
  
    <p>
      This is a great way to focus on tricky parts of the song.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Note: You might have noticed that the purple color of the timeline 
      changed when 
      you select start and stop-markers. The purple part is the 
      "active playing region" and indicates simply where Troff will 
      start and end.
    </p>
		<p>
			If Troff should start playing at the beginning of the active playing region,
			when pressing space, enter or the play pause button,
			can be edited in the Global Settings.<br />
			But you can always more the cursor to the beguining by pressing "G", 
			as in "Go to marker".
		</p>

    <h3 id="playFullSong">play full song</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a small part selected and want to play the whole song
        you can either press the name of the first marker, and then the 
        stop-button of the last marker, or you can press "play full song" or (U)
        to select the first and last marker.
      </p>
    <h3 id="moveMarkers">move markers</h3>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways in which you can change the time of, or
      move, a marker.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you press (Shift + Up/Down), (Alt + Up/Down) or (Shift + Alt + Up/Down)
      the selected marker will move Up/Down by 1, 0.08 or 8 seconds 
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also click the edit button of the marker, 
      and change the time there.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you click "advanced" followed by "move markers" you can move all markers at the same time,
      or just the markers between the two selected ones 
      (including the selected markers).
    </p>
    <h3 id="exportImport">Export and import</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to share your markers to someone, 
        the members of you show-team or band for instance, press "advanced" followed by "import / export" and
        the import export dialog appears.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note: When you export, not only will your markers, marker-info,
        marker-color
        be exported, but the <a href="#states">states</a>,
        settings and <a href="#songInfo">song-info</a> as well. <br />
        More on that later. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are exporting you will get a long text-string. 
        Copy the text and share it with your friends that want to import 
        your settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        To import settings, click on "advanced" followed by "import / export" and then "import", paste the
        the text-string in the text-box and click ok.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Note: If you miss a single sign or character when copying or pasting, 
        the import will not work. Then, just try again.
      </p>
    <h3 id="deleteMarkers">Delete markers</h3>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways in which you can change delete one or several markers.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can click the edit button of the marker, and then press remove.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you click "advanced" followed by "delete markers" you will get an option to
      delete all markers at the same time,
      or just the markers between the two selected ones
      (including the selected markers).
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      When a marker is deleted, there will be a notification square letting you know
      that the marker has been deleted, as well as an undo-button in the top right corner.
    </p>
    <h3 id="stretchMarkers">Stretch markers</h3>
    <p>
      If you have markers for a song, and then stretch the length of the song in an external program
      (for instance; using Audacity going to Effect > Change Tempo)
      then the markers will no longer match the new length of the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you can stretch the markers. click "advanced" followed by "stretch marksers".
      stretching the markers to 200% will create
      twice as much space between the markers as before.
      Stretching them to 50% will reduce the space to half.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      There is no "undo" functionality when stretching markers,
      therefore it is recomended to export your markers and settings first
      so that you can undo the stretch if it did not match your desired result.
    </p>
    <h3 id="zoomOnTheTimeline">Zoom on the timeline</h3>
    <p>
      In Troff, you can zoom in on the timeline which makes it easier to for 
      example focus on a 3 minute song in an 1 hour movie, 
      or just to focus on a few bars in a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      You zoom by pressing "Zoom" or (Z), this will zoom the timeline to the 
      active playing region, hence select a marker before and after the area you
      want to zoom to and press (Z).
    </p>
    <p>
      To zoom out, either select the first and last marker 
      (by "play full song" or (U) ) or press "zoom out" (shift + Z)
    </p>
    
    
    <h3 id="startBeforeStopAfter">Start before and stop after</h3>
    <p>
      One way to work with markers is to set a marker at the start of every bar.
      Then have good short names for the markers and maybe colorize them in a 
      way so that they are easy to understand.
      This way, it is easy to find the particular part you want to practice. 
      However, you might not want Troff to start playing from the first beat, 
      but rather 3 seconds or so before, so that you can prepare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Troff lets you do exactly this with the "start before" functionality.
      If you toggle "start before" or (B) you will se that the 
      "active playing region" will change. If "start before" is active, 
      Troff will start to play the song a few seconds before the selected 
      marker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of seconds can be changed in the start before-number box, 
      or can be increased or decreased by (shift + B) and (alt + B) 
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "stop after" works in the same way but for the stop-selected marker.
    </p>
    <h3 id="loop">Play more than once</h3>
    <p>
      You can loop the selected playing region a number of times 
      by pressing the number of times you want it to play. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you press "&infin;", Troff will loop the selected part of the song
      until you pause it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pauses">Pause and wait</h3>
      <p>
        As default, Troff waits 3 seconds before starting to play a song. 
        This way you can hit play, and then have time to get in position
        before the song starts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can change the number of seconds Troff pauses before starting to
        play by changing the number in the "pause before"-number box 
        or by (shift + P) and (alt + P).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also quickly toggle if Troff should pause or not by pressing
        "pause before" (P).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wait between" works in the same way as "pause before" but it changes
        the time Troff will wait between loops. It lets you catch your breath
        before doing it again!
      </p>
    <h3 id="volumeAndSpeed">Volume and speed</h3>
    <p>
      Troff let you control the volume and speed of the song with a slider, 
      or by using the "+" and "-" buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you press "Volume" (V) or "Speed" (S) you will reset the values to 
      100%.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also increase or decrease the volume or speed by 
      (shift/alt + V) or (shift/alt + S) respectively. 
    </p>
  </article> <!-- Settings -->
  <article id="infoArea">
    <h2>The info area</h2>
    <p>
      The info area is an area where you can take and read notes regarding 
      the current song or marker and check the tempo of a song.
      If you play a movie in Troff, this will be displayed in the info area.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tapTempo">Tap tempo</h3>
    <p>
      If you repeatedly tap "Tempo" (T) to the tempo of the song, 
      Troff will calculate the tempo and display it. This tempo will be saved
      for the particular song. 
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Note: Troff will wait 3 seconds before saving the value, 
      so don't change song during that time!
    </p>
    <h3 id="songInfo">Song info</h3>
    <p>
      In the song info, you can write notes and information regarding 
      the current song. These notes will be saved per song and are
      easily accessable by selecting the song.
    </p>
    <h3 id="markerInfo">Marker info</h3>
    <p>
      The marker info works like the song info, but the text written there
      will be saved per marker. Hence, when another marker is selected, 
      the text displayed will change.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a great way to write things that you want to remember for 
      a specific part of the song.
    </p>
  </article> <!-- the info area -->
  <article id="countdown">
    <h2>The countdown area</h2>
    <p>
      The countdown area shows two things: <br />
      The top-number shows the number of seconds until the song will start. 
        It will count down during the "pause before" and the "wait between".
      <br />
      The bottom-number shows the number of loops that are left.
        It will count down for each time one loop is finished.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Note: The order of the two numbers match the order that you control
      these values in the Settings-area.
    </p>
  </article> <!-- countdown -->
  <article id="songsArea">
    <h2>The songs area</h2>
    <p>
      The song area is where you can select which song to play.
      The selected song is purple. If you can't find the song you want,
      it might be in another song list, or it has been removed from the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song area can either be in the attached state, then it will be next to the
      states and settings, or it can be in the floating state,
      then it be in a pop-up square.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change between the two states in the settings,
      or with the maximize (<i class="fa fa-window-maximize"></i>)
      and minimize (<i class="fa fa-window-minimize"></i>) buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the song is in the floating state,
      more info is available about the song in a sortable table.
    </p>
  </article> <!-- songs Area -->
  <article id="songLists">
    <h2>The song lists area</h2>
    <p>
      You can create song lists to only show a few songs in the songs area.
      Click "New song list", give it a name and select which songs / folders
      to be added.
    </p>
    <h3 id="addFolders">Add folders</h3>
    <p>
      If you only add songs, only those songs will be in the song list, 
      but if you add a folder, all the songs in that folder will be 
      in the song list. If new songs are added to the folder,
      they will appear in the song list the next time you start Troff!

  <article id="states">
    <h2>The states area</h2>
    <h3 id="whatIsStates">What is states</h3>
    <p>
      A "state" is something that saves all the values in the settings-area
      as well as all markers selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand when this is useful, imagine the following senario:
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets say you usually practice a guitarr solo of the song. 
      Then you always set the same markers, always set start before to 
      10 seconds and pause before set to off.
    </p>  
    <p>
      Lets say you also practise the ending of the song. 
      Then you have a diffrent set of markers and start before is set to
      3 seconds, and pause before is set to 3 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      States lets you quickly switch between these.
    </p>
    <h3 id="howToUseStates">How to use a state</h3>
    <p>
      Select the markers and settings you want to save then click 
      "remember state". Name the state and press "OK". 
    </p>
    <p>
      The state will appear as a button in the states list. 
      When you have another marker selected, you can simply press this state
      to recall the state. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Remove a state by pressing the "R"-button next to it.
    </p>

    <h3 id="fullscreen">Fullscreen</h3>
    <p>
      You can at any time toggle fullscreen by the (F)-key.

      (because "play in fillscreen" is active), simply press (F) to enter 
      fullscreen again.

    <h3 id="frameByFrame">Frame by frame stepping</h3>
    <p>
      Troff lets you examine what is happening in the moveie in detail by
      allowing frame by frame stepping:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use (alt + left / right arrow) to step one frame forward or backward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use (left / right arrow) to step one second forward or backward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use (shift + left / right arrow) to step 10 seconds forward or backward.
        </li>
      </ul>
